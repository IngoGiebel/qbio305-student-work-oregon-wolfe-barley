\section{Introduction}

Task definition:
Paper about the phenotypic variation measured in the Oregon Wolfe Barley collection. This paper has to follow the structure of a scientific journal paper and should include the following analyses:

- ANOVA of plant height
You find the data in \begin{verbatim}dta---ANOVA_QTLanalysis.csv\end{verbatim}, which includes the measurements of all groups. The group is actually not a replicate, because you just measured the same plant several times. However, for the purpose of this exercise pretend that the group is a valid replicate, and do not include it in your model.

- Genetic linkage mapping of the qualitative trait your group has scored (which marker is in closest linkage?)

- QTL analysis of plant height
You find the data in \begin{verbatim}dta---ANOVA_QTLanalysis.csv\end{verbatim}.

Submit your paper as a pdf to agatha.walla@hhu.de and timo.hellwig@hhu.de.
Deadline: December 22, 2023
